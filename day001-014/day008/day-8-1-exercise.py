# ## Area Calc

# # Instructions

# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters** of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

# number of cans = (wall height ✖️ wall width) ÷ coverage per can. 

# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

# number of cans = (2 ✖️ 4) ÷ 5 

#                          = 1.6

# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the **result should be rounded up** to **2** cans. 

# IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.

# # Example Input

# ```
# test_h = 3
# ```
# ```
# test_w = 9
# ```
# # Example Output
# ```
# You'll need 6 cans of paint.
# ```
# # Hint
# **1. To round up a number**:

# 2. Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code.

#Write your code above this line 👆
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
