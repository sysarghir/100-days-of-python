# Instructions
# Look at the code in the code editor on the left. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
#
# Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, 
# even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.
#
# Example Output
# When you run your program, it should print the following:
#
# Day 1 - String Manipulation
# String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
# New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
#
#
# Broken code:
#
# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")                           # Missing " at the begging of the string
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')       # Wrong use of concatenation | "" wrongly added around the + sign | double use of "" instead of '' and ""
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')                        # Idented when it shouldnt be
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")      # double ( at the begging of the function
