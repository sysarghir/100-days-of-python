# Instructions
# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
#
# Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
#
# Example Input
# 39
# Example Output
# 3 + 9 = 12
#
# 12
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:
