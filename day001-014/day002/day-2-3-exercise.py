# Your Life in Weeks
# Instructions
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
#
# https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
#
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
#
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
#
# Example Input
# 56
# Example Output
# You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

#
# Hint
# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
# Try copying the example output into your code and replace the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.

years_left = 90 - float(age)
days_left = round(years_left) * 365
weeks_left = round(years_left) * 52
month_left = round(years_left) * 12

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, and {month_left} months left.")
