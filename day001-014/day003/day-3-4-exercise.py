# ## Pizza Order
# # Instructions
# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program. 
# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill. 
# ```
# Small Pizza: $15
# ```
# ```
# Medium Pizza: $20
# ```
# ```
# Large Pizza: $25
# ```
# ```
# Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
# ```
# ```
# Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
# ```
# ```
# Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1
# ```
# # Example Input
# ```
# size = "L"
# ```
# ```
# add_pepperoni = "Y"
# ```
# ```
# extra_cheese = "N"
# ```
# # Example Output
# ```
# Your final bill is: $28.
# ```
# e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# # Hint
# 1. Think about what you've learnt about multiple if statements and see if you can reduce the number of lines of code while having the same functionality.
